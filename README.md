# Tree Project Challenge

This was a coding challenge aimed to create a modal like component that listed all the DOM elements as folders and the contents as files. This used jQuery to handle the drop down events.

(In production) - designing the treeTraversal function which will read a html file and recreate the DOM tree as an object. Which will be re-renderd for the tree.html.
